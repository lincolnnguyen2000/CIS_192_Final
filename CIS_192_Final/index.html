        Hello! My name is Lincoln Nguyen and I'm majoring in Computer Engineer. I transferred
        from Pasadena City College and now I am a student at the University of California Irvine. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Some of my hobbies include jogging, reading, and studying. I enjoy programming and 
        have completed all lower-division math courses, general physics courses, and multiple Computer Science courses. 
        My main focus throughout my college career is to obtain a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree.
        I possess fast learning, communication, and organizational skills. 
        Additionally, my skills extend to proficient use of Microsoft Office and comprehension of multiple programming languages. 
    </p>
